                   <div>
                    <p>I am Amiri Hayes, a high school student from New Jersey who has been homeschooled since my sophomore year of high school. Since then, I’ve concurrently taken high school and college courses at Rowan College of South Jersey. I will graduate RCSJ with two Associates Degrees in Physics and Computer Science, as well as a state-issued high school diploma. To date, I have earned 91 College Credits and am currently eligible to graduate.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Outside of school, I’m chronically outside: I love skateboarding, biking and exploring. I also studied gymnastics for three years and competed as a diver for my first two years of high school, making it to the Junior Olympic team of my Club. Homeschooling has been a very valuable experience for me and I’ve learned a lot of qualities like persistence, patience and creativity. Due to the freedom that creating my own schedule has provided, I’ve been able to participate in research and focus on particular subjects or activities as I progressed through my education.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I designed and programmed this website to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript for my Web Design Class in 10th grade. I was in total control of setting up my schedule, finding online resources, and deciding what to include; I have periodically updated it ever since. Available on this website is information about my work experience and the research I have been apart of as well as programming projects I have created or am in the middle of finishing. Hayes Homeschool taught me many things, and autonomy is one of the most important ones I’ve learned so far. Feel free to look around!</p>
